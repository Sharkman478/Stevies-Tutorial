# Stevie's Tutorial

The purpose of this tutorial is to decypher a regex expression and understand what each part of the expression is doing. By doing this we can further understand regex and how it can be used in our every day code. The tutorial will go over each part of a specific regex expression and break down what each function does in the expression.

## Summary

This is the regex expression that I have chosen for this tutorial. This regex expression is used to match emails and to verifiy sombodies input of an email to make sure that the email is valid. This is a very useful regex expression and it is used almost everywhere, where somebody signs up to link an email to a website this regex expression validates that it is a real email address.

Matching an Email: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
